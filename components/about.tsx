        <span className="italic">What excites me most about programming</span> is the problem-solving aspectâ€”the thrill of finding solutions to complex challenges keeps me motivated. I'm always eager to explore new technologies and expand my skill set. Currently, I&apos;m seeking a{" "}

        When I&apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll find me playing video games, enjoying movies, or spending time with my dog. I also have a curious mind and enjoy learning about{" "}
